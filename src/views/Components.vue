    <h1>Components</h1>

    <article>
      <p>
        Components allow us to split the UI into independent and reusable pieces, and think about each piece in
        isolation. It's common for an app to be organized into a tree of nested components
      </p>
    </article>

    <section>
      <p>
        Notice that when clicking on the buttons, each one maintains its own, separate count. That's because each time
        you use a component, a new instance of it is created.

      <h2>Passing Props</h2>

      <h2>Listening to Events</h2>
      <article>
        <p>As we develop our BlogPost component, some features may require communicating back up to the parent.</p>
      </article>
      <p>
        The child component can emit an event on itself by calling the built-in $emit method, passing the name of the
        event
      </p>
      <div :style="{ fontSize: postFontSize + 'rem' }">
        <BlogPost v-for="post in posts" :key="post.id" :title="post.title" @enlarge-text="enlargeText" />
      </div>

      <h2>Content Distribution with Slots</h2>
      <article>
        <p>We use the Slot as a placeholder where we want the content to go â€“ and that's it. We're done!</p>

      <h2>Dynamic Components</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Sometimes, it's useful to dynamically switch between components, like in a tabbed interface:</p>
      </article>
      <p>{{ '<component :is="tabs[currentTab]"></component>' }}</p>
